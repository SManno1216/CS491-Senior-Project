                I have always had a passion to educate young minds and help them blossom into well-rounded,
            responsible and successful individuals. Throughout my 29 years of teaching, I have had
            wonderful opportunities to teach diverse groups of students, including those with learning
            differences, those who performed at grade level and those who were gifted. As a result, I have
            become proficient at designing creative and stimulating lesson plans, which accommodate
            multiple intelligences, bring a hands-on approach to learning and keep students interested and
            focused.
            <br>
            My greatest desire is to inspire and motivate students. I actively engage each student by
            incorporating a variety of manipulatives, enjoyable activities and cooperative learning projects. I
            tailor lesson plans to meet their diverse interests, as well as demonstrate direct connections
            between the classroom and everyday life. The lessons I provide students support strong literacy
            skills and I try to ensure each student become a proficient reader, writer, speaker and a lifelong
            learner.
            <br>
            Having been an Education Major at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill NY, I am a certified
            elementary education teacher in NJ and NY. I hold a M.A. in Educational Leadership and
            Supervision from St. Peter's University and I have successfully completed the Orton Gillingham
            Program at Fairleigh Dickinson University. I am constantly looking for new approaches to reach
            all students and develop each one into a strong reader.
